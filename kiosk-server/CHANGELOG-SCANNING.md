# Network Scanning Enhancement - Changelog

## Summary

Upgraded the network scanning system from basic ARP-only scanning to a comprehensive multi-method device discovery system with intelligent filtering and vendor identification.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Enhanced Dependencies** (package.json)
Added three new optional packages:
- `bonjour` (v3.5.0) - mDNS/Bonjour service discovery
- `oui` (v12.0.61) - Comprehensive MAC vendor database (40,000+ entries)
- `node-arp` (v1.0.6) - Enhanced ARP table access

### 2. **Improved ARP Scanning** (server.js)
- Added intelligent filtering to remove:
  - Broadcast addresses (255.255.255.255, x.x.x.255)
  - Multicast addresses (224.x.x.x - 239.x.x.x)
  - Multicast MAC addresses (01:00:5e:xx:xx:xx)
  - Network addresses (x.x.x.0)
  - Loopback addresses (127.x.x.x)
- Result: Clean device list with only real network devices

### 3. **Multi-Method Scanning** (server.js)
Implemented three scanning methods that run in parallel:
- **Bonjour/mDNS**: Fast discovery of devices advertising services
- **ARP Table**: Quick MAC address and IP discovery
- **Nmap**: Advanced OS and service detection (when available)

### 4. **Scan Modes** (server.js)
Added three scan intensity levels:
- **Fast** (3-5s): Bonjour + ARP + basic nmap ping
- **Detailed** (10-30s): + OS detection + common port scanning
- **Aggressive** (30-120s): + full port scan (1-1000) + service versions

### 5. **Enhanced Device Information** (server.js)
Now gathers:
- IP address and MAC address
- Hostname (from network)
- Vendor (from MAC OUI database)
- Device type (auto-identified: Windows PC, Linux Server, Printer, Router, etc.)
- Operating system (with accuracy percentage)
- Open ports with service names and versions
- Bonjour/mDNS advertised services
- Scan sources used to detect the device

### 6. **Vendor Name Cleanup** (server.js)
Added `cleanVendorName()` function to:
- Remove verbose company addresses
- Strip corporate suffixes (Inc., Corp., Ltd., etc.)
- Remove redundant words (Technologies, Electronics, etc.)
- Limit length to 30 characters
- Result: "Intel Corporate" instead of "Intel Corporate Lot 8, Jalan Hi-Tech 2/3 Kulim Kedah 09000 Malaysia"

### 7. **Device Type Identification** (server.js)
Added `identifyDeviceType()` function that detects:
- Windows PC (RDP port 3389)
- Linux/Unix Server (SSH port 22)
- Mac/iOS/Android (OS detection)
- Printer (IPP service or printer ports)
- Router/Switch (network vendor)
- Raspberry Pi (MAC vendor)
- Virtual Machine (VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V)
- Media Device (AirPlay, RAOP)
- File Server (SMB, AFP)
- Web Server (HTTP/HTTPS ports)

### 8. **Data Merging** (server.js)
Added `mergeDeviceData()` function to:
- Combine results from multiple scan methods
- Prefer more detailed information
- Track which methods detected each device
- Eliminate duplicates

### 9. **New API Endpoints** (server.js)
- `GET /api/lan/scan?mode=fast|detailed|aggressive` - Multi-method scan
- `GET /api/lan/scan/:ip` - Detailed single device scan
- `GET /api/lan/arp-debug` - Debug endpoint for ARP parsing

### 10. **Enhanced UI** (public/js/main.js)
- Added scan summary header showing:
  - Number of devices found
  - Scan duration
  - Methods used
  - Scan mode
- Display device type in parentheses
- Show hostname if different from device name
- Better formatting and readability

### 11. **Documentation** (README.md, SCANNING-API.md)
- Updated README with comprehensive scanning features section
- Created detailed API reference document
- Added troubleshooting tips
- Documented scan modes and device types

### 12. **Testing Tools** (test-arp.js)
Created test script to verify:
- ARP command execution
- Parsing logic
- Filtering rules
- Vendor identification

## Results

### Before
- Basic ARP scan only
- 13 devices found (including broadcast/multicast)
- Only IP and MAC addresses
- Generic "Unknown Vendor" for most devices

### After
- Multi-method scanning (Bonjour + ARP + Nmap)
- 6 real devices found (filtered correctly)
- Rich device information:
  - **192.168.0.1** - D-Link (Router)
  - **192.168.0.17** - Visionscape (Samsung device)
  - **192.168.0.41** - Intel (LG Electronics device)
  - **192.168.0.122** - Intel (Apple device)
  - **192.168.0.175** - Unknown (Local MAC)
  - **192.168.0.194** - Intel device

## Installation

To use the new features:

```powershell
cd kiosk-server
npm install
```

Then restart the server. The enhanced scanning will work immediately with ARP. For full features (Bonjour, comprehensive vendor database), the new packages must be installed.

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backward compatible**
- All new packages are optional
- Falls back to basic ARP scanning if packages aren't installed
- Existing API endpoints unchanged
- UI works with both old and new response formats

## Performance

- **Fast mode**: 3-5 seconds (suitable for UI)
- **Detailed mode**: 10-30 seconds (recommended for management)
- **Aggressive mode**: 30-120 seconds (for security audits)

## Security Notes

- Network scanning may trigger security alerts
- Some features require elevated privileges (OS detection)
- Always have authorization before scanning networks
- Consider using ADMIN_TOKEN to restrict access
